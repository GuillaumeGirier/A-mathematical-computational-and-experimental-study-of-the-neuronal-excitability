## ABSTRACT

Neuronal excitability refers to the ability of neurons to generate electrical signals, called action potentials, in response to stimuli. This concept can be studied through different aspects (mathematical, computational, and experimental). In this thesis, we aim to study neuronal excitability by integrating these different aspects when necessary to extract new insights through five different projects.

In the first project, we will mathematically investigate the behavioral transition between integrator neurons (type-I neuron models) and resonator neurons (type-II neuron models) in mathematical models of neurons while preserving the properties that characterize integrator neurons.

In the second project, we will analyze neuronal data obtained from patch-clamp recordings of Granule Cells (GC) during their development. During a transient period of maturation, new GCs exhibit intrinsic and synaptic properties distinct from mature GCs, potentially underlying the contribution of neurogenesis to memory encoding. We will develop a model adapted to this behavior.

In two related projects, we will focus on obtaining bifurcation diagrams from noisy experiments using methods inspired by digital continuation, called Control-Based Continuation in Experiments (CBCE). The idea is to apply closed-loop control to an experiment and iteratively bring the control to a noninvasive state, revealing the attractor of the uncontrolled experiment.

In the final project, we will analyze calcium imaging data from the olfactory bulb of several mice exposed to different chemicals. Our main objective is to highlight neural reaction patterns to stimuli and develop a pipeline to compare the activity of different subjects using odotopic maps.
